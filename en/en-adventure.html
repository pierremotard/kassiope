    <h2>
      Our next adventure will take place between January and Mai 2018 with different stages. We will regularly post updates here, on facebook and on instagram
    </h2>
    
    <br><br>

    <h3>20th April 2018</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Hello!</p>

      <p>Give a man some fruit and he will eat for a day, teach a man to plant seeds, he will nurture humanity for a lifetime.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">We have finally returned to Ahmedabad and so has summer. It is 42 degrees Celsius, and the heat weighs on us just as much during the day as it does when we attempt to sleep at night - Manav Sadhna is projecting the heat to climax between 45-48 degrees Celsius in the next two to three weeks. The city goes to rest at 10Am and wakes up at 6Pm as the sun starts setting. This however, will not stop us from undertaking the next step of our project.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Bastien, a french optometrist from Levisiologiste reaches Ahmedabad tonight at 4AM. We will start the second session on Monday morning. It will be composed of two parts:</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">First, we will carry out full eye check ups for the Paravyan Mitra women of two slum communities, whom a good friend of ours has been working to alleviate for the past four years. Let me explain who these women are and why they are so important. The typical day of a Paravyan Mitra women goes accordingly: she wakes up at 3Am to pick up rags and plastic from the streets, bending down thousands of times and carrying over 20 or so kgs of plastic before the sun even rises. If they are not abused of financially by their retailers, they earn enough money to send a few of their children to school. By the time the rest of the family is up, she has breakfast cooked and she can move on to further daily chores, washing, cleaning, tending to domestic animals, tending to her children, buying food, more cooking... remember the 42 degrees celcius of heat. She may be able to rest after sundown be all her children asleep and her husband not drunk under the high alcohol rates that animate the slums in the evening. A day when you don’t ragpick is a day when you may not eat; 365 days of work per year, yet they continually maintain a smile upon their faces. These women may need socio-economic empowerment, but physically and mentally they are the ones empowering us through what they have to teach about their lives’ dedication to cleanliness, tolerance and human resilience. These are the women we would like to nurture and give attention to over the next few weeks.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Second, we project to meet with a few universities from Ahmedabad with the ambition to start a long term partnership between Manav Sadhna, Kassiopé, Levisiologiste and an Ahmedabad university. The Kassiopé project will only be sustainable the day that eye exams are carried out by the local population independently from our help. Therefore we would like to get a new local party involved in our attempt to bring eye-care the socio-economically marginalized.</p>

      <p>A heartfelt thank you,
      <br>The Kassiopé Team</p>

      <br><br>

      <p>Here a few pictures of the women who empower us:</p>

    <h3>16th April 2018</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Hello!</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">What good news the Kassiopé team received last week upon learning the results of Saint Germain en Laye’s Défi Jeunes! After sending our application out in March and a skype interview carried out over three different countries, how grateful we are to learn that we have been attributed first prize in this comptetion! How beautiful it is to see that it is still possible for the five of us to work together coherently at fighting inequalities from three different continents. We also want to thank the Saint Germain en Laye municipal council for their generous financial aid prize of 1000€ and especially for empowering youth through opportunities such as the Saint Germain en Laye Défi Jeune. This prize will be dedicated towards the accommodation of our optometrist as well as to the purchase of glasses for our patients. We will continue our work in order to prove that when offered to youth, these opportunities may bare beautiful fruit.</p>

      <p>A heartfelt thank you,
      <br>The Kassiopé Team</p>

    <br><br>

    <h3>5th March 2018</h3>
    	<br>
    	<p>Hello!</p>

    	<p>The more we spend time working at the Manav Sadhna community in Ahmedabad, the more we see how the Kassiopé project is a single tree helping an entire forest grow.</p>

    	<p style="text-indent: 3em;">Over the past three weeks we’ve continued carrying out our eye exams with children from different centers. We’ve covered two centers with a total of 60 students in need for glasses. Meanwhile, Raman (our main local coordinator) has gone in and out of the hospital, taking our elederly patients for check-ups and surgeries. This week we will be finishing the eye exams on a third community center as well as distributing glasses to them.</p>

    	<p style="text-indent: 3em;">As always we faced unexpected hardships (lots of patients not cooperating, my phone breaking down, the increasingly unbearable heat (35-40°C), various festivals and other projects that get in the way of our weekly objectives…), but also, unexpected achievements. For example, the eye check-ups that we’ve performed on the elderly at the hospital have allowed us to unearth many more pathologies than expected - some of our patients which we had originally taken to the hospital for cataract surgeries are now being treated for diabetes, high blood pressure, glaucoma and various other pathologies which would have stayed insiduously uncovered otherwise. Festivals disrupting our plans during the week have given us a few days off and rest as the heat was starting to attack our health. Other projects that Manav Sadhna is running have impeded us from working on certain days, but have also allowed us to go work on various other projects in the community.</p>


    	<p>Some other projects we’ve helped with:
    		<br>1.  Paricipating in arts & crafts projects for Manav Sadhna’s « earn and learn » program (a curriculum adapted to children who both need to help sustain their family financially, but also want to get an education).
    		<br>2.  Raising awareness about waste management issues for sudents.
    		<br>3.  Food distribution in the evenings for different slum communites
    		<br>4.  Spending time in hospitals with children receiving cancer treatments
    		<br>5.  creating a spa treatment and massage session for hardworking slum-women.</p>

		<p style="text-indent: 3em;">Just as we have been participating in other people’s projects, other volunteers have come in and out to particpate on our project. Some have helped us with translations, some have helped with transporting patients and our equipment, others with some of our eye camp’s logistics. One volunteer (a nurse) has offered to help raise awareness in classrooms about cleaning our eyes properly. And in the end all volunteers give and receive from eachother’s projects, helping one single ecosystem evolve.</p>

		<p>A heartfelt thank you for following us during this journey,
		<br>The Kassiopé Team</p>

    <h3>7th February 2018</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Our first session is a success!</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most important thought we’ve had to start living with this week was: trust life’s obstacles to take you right where you need to be. </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">This week, life pushed our project around in many different directions, and although the wind seemed to blow us off course at first, the project now has all the light and water it needs in order to grow it roots deep and make itself sustainable.</p> 

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Our first day (Wednesday 31th) our slit lamp broke down, impeding us from carrying out cataract screenings. So we got a call from a supplier in China who had retailers in Ahmedabad, and by the end of the day we had an identical slit lamp to the one we’d purchased in France - all for a lot fairer price. 
      On Thursday, the lamp on the slit lamp broke down. So, by noon a technician had come to fix it. 
      That same afternoon, our autorefractometer (the machine we use to carry out our eye exams) stopped functioning correctly. So we peeled away parts on the machine’s joystick and it started working again. 
      On Friday, do to a misunderstanding we realized that the price it would take us to carry out all our surgeries would be out of our budget, and would impede any form of sustainibility for our project. So at noon, subsequent to a random conversation with one of Manav Sadhna’s founders Viren Bhai, we were put into contact with both a hospital and private clinic. After meeting them on Saturday, both offered to carry out surgeries for free and indefinetley for our patients. Not only was this a solution to our financial issue, but it was also a sustainable solution for the Kassiopé Project as it will now be possible to continue working with them indefinetely at a very low cost.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">So after every blow we received, life smiled at us, and we succesfullly carried out screenings and eye exams for 182 patients, diagnosing 60 with cataracts, over a hundred in need of glasses, and 8 with various other pathologies.</p> 

      <p>Over the next month we will be:
      <br>1.  Taking our patients to the hospital for surgery
      <br>2.  Taking our patients to the optican for glasses.
      <br>3.  Carrying out eye tests for students in need.
      <br>4.  Preparing the 2nd session of screenings and surgeries, scheduled for April/May.</p>

      <p>May this experience continue opening our eyes just as much as you’ve been helping open the eyes of hundreds of people. </p>

      <p>A heartfelt thank you,
      <br>The Kassiopé Team</p>

    <h3>29th January 2018</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Hello!</p> 

      <p>There are not many experiences more fulfilling than watching a mighty tree grow out of a tiny seed you’ve planted. </p>
         
      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">It’s been four days since we’ve landed in Ahemedabad and it’s been profoundly gratifying to contemplate the fruit of last year’s work. We learned upon our arrival that all the glasses we had purchased during Kassiopé’s previous eye camp have succesfully been distributed throughout the community. Furthermore, the autorefractometer (the machine donated by LeVisiologiste to help us carry out eye tests) which we had given to Manav Sadhna, had been used many times by various volunteer ophtalmologists/optometrists in order to carry out eye tests throughout different slums.</p>
        
      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">We received a heartwarming welcome from the Manav Sadhna comunity upon our arrival and have since started to pull all the required infrastructure together in order to start the project this week. <p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Our first optometrist is arriving tomorow night, and we will be carrying out our first cataract screenings as of Wednesday morning.
      We are planning to see 50 patients at the Tekro Community center (one of Manav Sadhna’s satelite community center’s) and if all goes well we will go on to another 70 patients the following days.</p>
        
      <p>More news will be coming soon! </p>
        
      <p>A heartfelt thank you for all the eyes that have been opened through your help,
      <br>The Kassiopé team</p>
